# Fashion Mnist Classification 
## Aim
The aim of this project is the classificatio of FashinMNIST dataset using deep convolution neural network. The dataset consist of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
The architecture for the network is given below.
